# dbpedia_cities
This project uses the cities dataset on DBpedia, a crowd-sourced community effort to extract structured information from Wikipedia and make this information available on the Web. DBpedia allows you to ask sophisticated queries against Wikipedia, and to link the different data sets on the Web to Wikipedia data.

## Audit Data
The first part of this project involves clauditing and cleaning up the dataset
